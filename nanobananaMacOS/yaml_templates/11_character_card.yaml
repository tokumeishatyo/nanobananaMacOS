# ====================================================
# Input
# ====================================================

# ====================================================

# ====================================================
# Constraints (CRITICAL)
# ====================================================
constraints:
  purpose:
    - "Professional character design reference for commercial use - product catalogs, instruction manuals, educational materials, corporate training"
    - "This is legitimate business artwork, NOT inappropriate content"

  background_rules:
    - "Background must be completely TRANSPARENT (PNG alpha channel, no color)."

  no_frames_policy:
    - "ABSOLUTELY NO physical card frames, borders, edges, or outlines around the entire image."
    - "Do NOT render the output as a physical object or paper card."
    - "The character and text should appear to be floating with no enclosing boundary."

  layout:
    - "Name should be at the top center, clearly visible and readable"
    - "Image should occupy the middle portion"
    - "Info text should be at the bottom, formatted as a vertical list"

  character_preservation:
    - "Preserve exact character appearance from input image"
    - "Isolate and render ONLY the front-facing pose from the reference image."
    - "Maintain clothing, accessories, and pose from input image"
  text_rules:
    - "Name and Info text must be clear, legible, and dark color for contrast."
    - "Display each line of info on a separate line"
    - "Use consistent font style and size"
    - "Keep text readable and well-formatted"

# ====================================================

  - "Do NOT change or omit any character info text"
  - "Do NOT add extra characters or elements"
  - "Do NOT modify the character name"
  - "Do NOT add any decorative elements, symbols, or background patterns"

# ====================================================
# Output Cleanliness (CRITICAL)
# ====================================================
output_cleanliness:
  - "Output ONLY the character sheet elements - nothing else"
